This project is a RESTful API for managing ToDo tasks, built with Django REST Framework. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete tasks, allowing users to organize their work efficiently. Each task contains details such as name, description, due date, status, and priority. The API leverages generic class-based views and serializers to keep the code clean and maintainable.
